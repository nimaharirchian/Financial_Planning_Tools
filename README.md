# Financial_Planning_Tools
---
##### There was two parts to this challenge. The *first part* of this activity was to create a financial planner for emergencies and see if they have enough capital for an emergency fund. The *second part* of this challenge was to plan for retirement and run a monte carlo simulation to forecast the performance of a retirement portfolio after 10 and 30 years when the portfolio is heavily weighted 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds.
